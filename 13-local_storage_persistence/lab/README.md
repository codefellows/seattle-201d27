# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 13

There are multiple things to do in today's lab:

- Mop-up of assignment pieces from the prior two days
- The new technical requirement for local storage
- A new stretch goal that you may work on individually.

### New Bus Mall Technical Goal

- Give your BusMall app persistence by using local storage to store your voting data! The goal is to have all of your data persist through a page refresh or through completely closing the browser. That way, the more time you go through the sets of 25 votes, the more the data accumulates and you get a more reliable understanding of which items are popular.
- Keep in mind that working on verifying that your local storage is working properly will involve repeated clearing and resetting of local storage data.

Be sure to go back and re-read the original problem domain from Class 11. Today we'll be focusing on implementing all of the little pieces that have not been finished so far. Make sure you are not forgetting anything.

##### Hmmm... a stretch goal?

- *"The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown. So, you'll also need to keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the associated calculations."*

- Stretch goal (not required, but work on it if you'd like an additional challenge): Prepare a report for the marketing team that gives them a table of data analysis on a separate HTML page (or on your exiting `index.html` page below the chart, maybe something like this:

![table](table-sample.png)

- If you choose to build the table, you can do so however you want and also customize however you think is appropriate. Think back to your Salmon Cookie table.

- ***If*** you do this on a separate HTML page, you can use the data you stored in local storage, maybe, right? That would be a way to foreshadow the lab for tomorrow.

- You are also responsible for the overall look and feel of the app (the UI/UX, in other words), so don't forget a custom font, color palette, layout with semantic HTML, and so on. The basic layout of three side-by-side-by-side images with a chart underneath holds, but beyond that, it's all you. Make it look good, and easy to use!!!
